This project involves building a To-Do List API using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core,Sql server, Swagger, and other tools. The API allows users to manage tasks, including creating, updating, marking as completed, and deleting tasks. An optional feature is the ability to categorize tasks for better organization. Additionally, the tech stack includes unit testing with MSTest, version control with Git, and the option to implement JWT authentication for enhanced security.
